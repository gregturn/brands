This project is used to test features in Spring Data REST related to https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-hateoas/issues/250.

With the code in this project, this is what I was able to do:

First, test that the database loader has created one entry.

----
$ curl localhost:8080/brands
{
  "_links" : {
    "self" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/brands{?page,size,sort}",
      "templated" : true
    }
  },
  "_embedded" : {
    "brands" : [ {
      "name" : "Pivotal",
      "_links" : {
        "self" : {
          "href" : "http://localhost:8080/brands/1"
        }
      }
    } ]
  },
  "page" : {
    "size" : 20,
    "totalElements" : 1,
    "totalPages" : 1,
    "number" : 0
  }
}
----

This clearly shows that the paging feature is here. It starts out with *Pivotal* brand at `/brands/1`.

Now, with verbosity switched on, attempt to *PUT* the same entity with a different name.

----
$ curl -v -X PUT -d '{"name":"Alibastine"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:8080/brands/1
* Adding handle: conn: 0x7fecb2004000
* Adding handle: send: 0
* Adding handle: recv: 0
* Curl_addHandleToPipeline: length: 1
* - Conn 0 (0x7fecb2004000) send_pipe: 1, recv_pipe: 0
* About to connect() to localhost port 8080 (#0)
*   Trying ::1...
* Connected to localhost (::1) port 8080 (#0)

----

Looks alright. Same *Location* as we started with. Now let's check the outcome:

----
$ curl localhost:8080/brands
{
  "_links" : {
    "self" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/brands{?page,size,sort}",
      "templated" : true
    }
  },
  "_embedded" : {
    "brands" : [ {
      "name" : "Alibastine",
      "_links" : {
        "self" : {
          "href" : "http://localhost:8080/brands/1"
        }
      }
    } ]
  },
  "page" : {
    "size" : 20,
    "totalElements" : 1,
    "totalPages" : 1,
    "number" : 0
  }
}
----

`/brands/1` is clearly updated.
